## To quickly make changes to front-end of the site, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Index.html file in the website folder, located here: <https://github.com/developmentseed/MIX-Nigeria/blob/gh-pages/index.html>.  

2. Enter edit mode by clicking on the 'Edit this file' button, located in the upper right corner of the file window.

3. Simple html changes can be made to the code in the window. Enter changes as needed.  

4. After edits have been made, note any changes made in the comment window, and then click 'Commit Changes' button.  This will upload the changes to the site and immediately become live.

## Staging

A copy of the entire site is in the staging directory. You can access this version of the site by going to http://nigeria.mixmarket.org/staging. To preview changes you wish to make to the site, edit files in the staging folder. When you'd like those changes to be live on the main site, copy the files you've changed over the files in the website folder (gh-pages branch).
